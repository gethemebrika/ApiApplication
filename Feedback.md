## Solution Design
I have changed The project architecture design, to make it more scalable, and maintainable.
I have separate the Persistance layer from the presentation layer and business layer. 

## Version Control System
I have create a git repository, in other to follow a git flow, and also have a CI which will run unit and integration test.
For me this should be a must have in the development process of any project in other to have good code quality and also prevent eventually bug in production. 


## TDD 

I do usually use TDD (Test driven development). This help me  to produce a maintainable, testable and good quality code base.
